 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
 that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and
 vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional
 functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall
 and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on
 previous commands.

Description
===========
Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts
 to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts can adapt the
 packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf
 creates a configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
 operating system features that the package can use, in the form of M4 macro calls.
